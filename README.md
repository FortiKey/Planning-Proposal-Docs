## Description

### Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to provide businesses with a **easy-to-implement and secure Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) platform**.  The platform enables businesses to protect thier users' accounts from unathorised access by introducing a second layer of authentication beyond the more traditional *username and password* logins.  This platform is designed to help businesses address increasing security concerns in a cost-effective way, without requiring extensive technical expertise to intergrate the solution.  

Additionally, the platform offers a dashboard and API documentation to make integration seamless and user-friendly for developers working with businesses.


### Functionality / Features:

1. **Business Registration and Login:**
    - Businesses can register for an account using their email and password.  
    - Once logged in, they can access their API key for 2FA integration.  
    - Option to reset or regenerate API keys for security purposes.  

2. **Two-Factor Authentication API:**  
    - **Generate QR Code for TOTP Setup:** Businesses can use an endpoint to generate a QR code for their users to scan using apps like Google Authenticator or Authy.  
    - **Validate OTP:** Businesses can use another endpoint to validate OTPs entered by their users during login.  
    - **Usage Logs API:** Businesses can query usage logs to monitor 2FA activity (e.g., the number of successful and failed verifications).  

3. **Backup Codes:** 
    - Businesses can use the API to generate backup codes for users, which can be used in case they lose access to their TOTP device.  

4. **Business Dashboard:**  
    - **A web interface for businesses to:**  
        - View their account details and manage API keys.  
        - Access usage analytics (e.g., total number of 2FA verifications, failed OTP attempts).  
        - View and download API integration documentation.  
    - The dashboard will be responsive, providing seamless access on desktop and mobile devices.  

5. **API Documentation:**  
    - A detailed, developer-friendly guide to help businesses integrate 2FA into their applications.  
    - Includes examples of API requests and responses in JSON format, making the onboarding process smooth.  

6. **Security Features:**  
    - All sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys, TOTP secrets) is stored securely using best practices (e.g., hashed with bcrypt, encrypted TOTP secrets).  
    - API rate limiting middleware to prevent abuse (express-rate-limit library).  
    - Detailed logs and monitoring to track unauthorised attempts and system performance.  

### Target Audience:
1. **Small-to-Medium Businesses:**  
    - Companies looking for a simple, plug-and-play 2FA solution to enhance their platform's security.  
    - Businesses that donâ€™t have the technical bandwidth to build a custom 2FA solution.  

2. **Developers:**  
    - Developers tasked with adding 2FA functionality to a business's existing applications.  
    - Developers who need an easy-to-follow API with integration examples to minimise time-to-market.  

3. **Security-Conscious Enterprises:**  
    - Larger organisations seeking to add robust authentication mechanisms without diverting resources into building their own solutions.  

4. **Freelance Developers or Agencies:**  
    - Professionals providing services to *small-to-medium sized businesses* that need secure user authentication.  


### Tech Stack:  

- **Frontend:**
    - `React.js` (for building the business dashboard with reusable components and responsive design).  
    - `Axios` (for handling API requests between the dashboard and backend).  

- **Backend:**  
    - `Node.js` with `Express` (to create scalable and secure API services).  
    - `OTPAuth` (to handle TOTP generation and OTP validation).  
    - Middleware `express-rate-limit` to secure APIs from abuse and brute force attacks.

- **Database:**  
    - `MongoDB Atlas` (a cloud database solution to store business and user-related data, including *TOTP secrets and logs*).  

- **Authentication:**  
    - `JSON Web Tokens (JWT)` for session and API authentication.  

- **Hosting:**  
    - **Frontend:** `Netlify` (for fast, reliable, and secure static hosting).  
    - **Backend:**  `Render` (to host backend services with scalability in mind).  

### Additional Highlights:  
1. **Scalability:**  
    - Designed to handle multiple businesses and their users with minimal latency.  
    - Can support future additions like SMS-based OTP, email verification, or push notifications.  

2. **Flexibility:**  
    - Businesses can easily integrate the API into existing applications regardless of their tech stack.  

3. **Ease of Use:** 
    - Focused on delivering an intuitive dashboard and detailed API documentation to make integration effortless.
